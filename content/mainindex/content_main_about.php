<h1>About $sitename</h1>

<h3>More about $sitename</h3>

<p>$sitename is the creation of <a href="http://apcala.com/ben">Ben Werdmuller</a> and <a href="http://elgg.net/dtosh">David Tosh</a>. The concept behind the system is to develop a fully customizable learning landscape. To achieve this $sitename is a hybrid of weblogging, e-portfolios and social networking. It is hoped this combination of features with help promote student engagement in learning through reflection in an academic and social setting.</p>

<p>Learning is not a solitary pursuit and we feel real strength can be achieved from the creation of learning communities. Students interacting with: peers, tutors, lecturers, resources etc. The sharing of knowledge, ideas and problems can help foster a sense of belonging and development. </p>

<p>There are two options to get an $sitename account. You can register for an individual account hosted by $sitename or you can take the system and install it on your own server. $sitename is an open source application.</p>

<p>Users of $sitename will have a digital repository of artefacts which can be private or shared within communities. They will have a weblog which will be able to link to artefacts in the repository creating a useful bed for reflection. The social networking protocol will allow users to join up and create a variety of learning communities. All elements and artefacts can have access privileges attached determining who can view them.</p>

<p>It is hoped $sitename will be a fun, useful tool which will place the student/learner at the center of their learning.</p>

<p>We would really appreciate all feedback and comments so we can continue to develop and improve the system. We would also appreciate details on your usage habits and features you would like to see added. </p>
