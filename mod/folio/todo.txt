------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tCourse Modifications
 * Make a more scalable (aka, pagination) way of viewing communities and users.  Takes too long to load all of the different people once we get lots of users involved.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General 
 - Go thru & clean up limit 1 statements -- i think that'll mess of up postgress
 - Clean-up @todo statements in code.
 - Rewrite the title property to that it strips out all html tags.  
 - Make a bulk download / upload for wiki pages.
Evaluate all queries to replace exec sql with the paramaterized form where input data is cleaned up.
   (look at 	$pages = get_records_sql( "SELECT page_ident, p.title FROM " . $CFG->prefix . "folio_page p " .
		"INNER JOIN " . $CFG->prefix . "users u ON p.user_ident = u.ident " .
		"WHERE LOWER(p.title) = ? AND p.newest = 1 AND LOWER(u.username) = ? " . 
		' LIMIT 1 ',
		array( $page, $user ) ); )


Page View
 - Treeview control will show a node as expandable even if the user doesn't have permission to view the child pages.


Page Edit
 - Delete
 - On Save
   - Make sure we're not overwriting an existing page.
 - The tree menu doesn't show if we're adding a new sibling page via clicking on [[link]]
 - Drag & Drop file and links
 - On creating a new page, the sidemenu stuff doesn't load at all.


Permissions
- Page create doesn't seem to be using the permission settings properly 
- Private security setting doesn't work properly for communities.  Private needs to be to the community, not to the user.
- Don't think that moderated security is working when logged in as news and editing nathan's pages.


Make email activity default to sending emails.

Spell-check isn't working.
 - This is a bug in core rich text editor box, there is an open issue in the elgg bugtracker.

RSS
 - Program in tags
 - Program in different authors
 - Add RSS code to posting blogs, blog comments, page comments, and files.

Delete
 - Minor bug, when deleting a child page, the treeview control still shows the parent as expandable.

need to
* set comments visibility to the same as the attached object, and then reset permissions upon a change in the holding obejct's permission set.
