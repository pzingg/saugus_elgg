TreeView - Release Notes

0.10.0

   * If the child collection changes prior to a refresh(), the icon is now
     changed appropriately.

   * Added TreeView removeChildren(node).  This will recursively purge the node's
     children, and reset its dynamic load state.  

   * previousSibling and nextSibling are now adjusted correctly when a
     node is deleted.

   * expand()/collapse() now will not expand/collapse the node if false is
     returned from the onExpand/onCollapse event handlers.

   * The onExpand and onCollapse events now fire before the node is expanded
     or collapsed so that the implementer can modify the node's child collection
     prior to display.

   * The childrenRendered property previous was used to indicate both that
     a dynamically loaded node has received its data, and also to indicate
     that the children html has been created.  This has been split into
     two properties.  dynamicLoadComplete and childrenRendered.

   * Implemented the renderHidden flag.  If set to true, the html for the entire
     tree will be created when tree.draw() is called, not just the html for the
     visible nodes.

   * Added an onLabelClick listener to TextNode

   * TreeView.removeNode no longer automatically refreshes the tree.  It has an
     optional parameter to perform the refresh.

   * removeNode can now be executed on nodes that have not been rendered.

   * You can now delete top-level nodes.

   * Added onCheckClick listener to the TaskNode example

   * Added Node.iconMode, which is a property that configures the way 
     dynamically loaded nodes are displayed when they are expanded and contain 
     no children.

   * TreeView/Node.setDynamicLoad now accepts an optional second parameter to 
     set the iconMode property.

   * Fixed an issue in the TaskNode.js example that prevented setting the checked
     state of a node through the constructor.

   * Fixed an issue in HTMLNode that caused rendering issues when hasIcon was 
     set to true.

   * Added TreeView.removeNode

   * Added Node.refresh
