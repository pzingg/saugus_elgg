Drag and Drop Release Notes

0.10.0

   * Improved the performance in intersect mode

   * It was possible for the drag and drop initialization to be skipped
     for very slow loading pages.  This was fixed.

   * New methods to exclude regions within your drag and drop element: 
     addInvalidHandleId(), addInvalidHandleClass()

   * Added an onAvailable handler that is executed after the initial state is set.

   * Drag and drop is more forgiving when the implementer attempts to create the
     instance prior to the element being in the document, but after the window
     load event has fired.
