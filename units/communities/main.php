    /*
    
        A brief explanation:
        
        Communities are a specialisation of users. Each community is just another
        row in the users table, albeit with user_type set to 'community', which
        allows it to have all the features of a regular user.
        
        Friendships are stored in the same way too, but displayed as memberships.
        The 'owner' field of the users table stores the moderator for a community
        (for regular users it's set to -1).
        
        TO DO:
        
            - Allow a moderator to restrict access to communities
            - Allow moderators to delete all weblog postings and file uploads
