Modifications to standard magpie release
========================================

rss_fetch.inc
=============

Elgg already has Snoopy.class.inc in /lib/snoopy/, so the require_once line can be 
changed to point to that one.

The function error() has to be renamed in order to avoid a clash with elgglib.php.
Currently, it is renamed to _magpie_error().
