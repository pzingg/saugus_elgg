Quick Elgg 0.6 install file
originally by Bill Fitzgerald
-----------------------------

1. Create a database.

2. Create a user on the database with all privileges (are all privileges
necessary?):

   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dbname.* TO dbuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY
'dbpass';

3. Write down the database name (created in step 1) and the database
user (created in step 2) and the password for the database user (dbpass,
created in step 2).

4. Create a directory outside the "public_html" directory -- this
directory can be named whatever you want.

5. Rename htaccess-dist to .htaccess.

6. Open config-dist.php (found in the root directory of the Elgg
directory structure). Rename this file config.php.

7. In config.php, edit the following values to get started. The
config.php file also contains good instructions:

   $CFG->sitename = ''; // The sitename can be anything

   $CFG->wwwroot = 'http://elgg.foo.org/'; // the address you put in
   the browser to access the Elgg site

   $CFG->dirroot = '/home/user/public_html/elgg/'; // a critical value
   -- make sure to use the correct path, make sure to end with a
   trailing slash

   $CFG->sysadminemail = 'bar@foo.org'; // If you're setting the site
   up, this is probably your email address

   $CFG->defaultlocale = 'en_GB'; // If the site will run in English,
   leave unchanged

   $CFG->publicreg = true; // see instructions in config.php

   $CFG->default_access = "LOGGED_IN"; // see instructions in config.php

   $CFG->dataroot = '/home/user/elggdata/'; // this is the directory
   created in step 4, above -- a critical value -- make sure to use the
   correct path, make sure to end with a trailing slash --


   $CFG->dbtype = 'mysql'; // for now
   $CFG->dbhost = 'localhost';
   $CFG->dbuser = ''; // set in step 2, above
   $CFG->dbpass = ''; // set in step 2, above
   $CFG->dbname = ''; // name of database created in step 1
   $CFG->dbpersist = false;
   $CFG->prefix = 'elgg';


8. Navigate to the url of the site. The database tables will be created,
and you should see a long line of messages indicating success. At the
bottom of the page, you will see a "Continue" button -- click it.

9. This will bring you the Elgg home screen. The main site admin is
already created: Username "News"; password "password". Log in as this
user and change the password to something more secure. Welcome to your
Elgg site.
